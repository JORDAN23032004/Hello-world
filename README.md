# Hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Tambe Tella Jordan, i am a cameroonian of 20years and i have a bachelors degree in physics. I recently developed a passion for quantum algorithms and artificial intelligence. My passion led me to Github, and though i don't yet clearly understand how it functions i hope it will be very fun and educative for me.
